# Escrow Wallet

1) The wallet is a smart contract developed to accept the specified transaction currency/tokens. 
2) Each transaction will have its own escrow wallet. There will be no central escrow wallet for security reasons.
3) Once the wallet is deployed it will be a "blank" wallet. This means the wallet will not be associated with a transaction.
4) Once the transaction is created the wallet will then be associated with the transaction and cannot be changed.
